	Abstract = {A core component of cognitive control - the ability to regulate thoughts and actions in accordance with internally represented behavioral goals - might be its intrinsic variability. In this article, I describe the dual mechanisms of control (DMC) framework, which postulates that this variability might arise from qualitative distinctions in temporal dynamics between proactive and reactive modes of control. Proactive control reflects the sustained and anticipatory maintenance of goal-relevant information within lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) to enable optimal cognitive performance, whereas reactive control reflects transient stimulus-driven goal reactivation that recruits lateral PFC (plus a wider brain network) based on interference demands or episodic associations. I summarize recent research that demonstrates how the DMC framework provides a coherent explanation of three sources of cognitive control variation - intra-individual, inter-individual and between-groups - in terms of proactive versus reactive control biases.},

	Abstract = {Error-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to work in conjunction with lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) as a part of an action-monitoring network, where errors signal the need for increased cognitive control. The neural mechanism by which this mPFC-lPFC interaction occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase and power from current-source-density-transformed electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task. Theta power in the mPFC was diminished on the trial preceding an error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics appeared to take place over a response-related background of oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization between FCz (mPFC) and F5/6 (lPFC) sites was robustly increased during error trials. The degree of mPFC-lPFC oscillatory synchronization predicted the degree of mPFC power on error trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta band may in part underlie a mechanism of communication between networks involved in action monitoring and cognitive control.},

@article{Doesburg,
	Abstract = {When attention is allocated to one visual hemifield, increased alpha power is observed in ipsilateral visual cortex. This has been attributed to synchronization of alpha-band oscillations within cortical regions which reflects inhibitory processing. Recent results, however, indicate that synchronization of alpha oscillations between cortical regions is relevant for transient functional coupling. Such coupling is thought to be involved in orienting attention to a specific region of the visual field. We thus hypothesized that alpha-band synchronization between low-level visual cortex and higher-level visual brain regions would be increased in the hemisphere contralateral to an attended location. To test this hypothesis we calculated phase synchronization between attention-related EEG source activations occurring between predictive directional cues and expected visual targets. Alpha amplitude (understood as an index of local synchronization) within low-level visual cortex was increased ipsilateral to attended locations and decreased contralateral to attended locations, consistent with alpha-band scalp topography and previous research relating local alpha power to active inhibition. Increased long-range alpha-band synchronization between low-level visual cortex and parietal cortex, however, was observed contralateral to the attended visual hemifield, whereas decreased synchronization (phase scattering) was observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These results identify a potential mechanism for the enhanced processing of stimuli appearing at attended locations, as long-range synchronization is thought to increase the fidelity and effectiveness of communication between brain areas. Our observation of inhibitory amplitude changes, interpreted as increased local-area synchronization, and facilitatory long-range synchronization demonstrates a functional dissociation for alpha-band synchronization across cortical scales.},

The need for efficient information flow through complex systems encourages small-world network structures. On the basis of these principles, a group of regions associated with top-down control was examined. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that each region had a specific combination of control signals; resting-state functional connectivity grouped the regions into distinct 'fronto-parietal' and 'cingulo-opercular' components. The fronto-parietal component seems to initiate and adjust control; the cingulo-opercular component provides stable 'set-maintenance' over entire task epochs. Graph analysis showed dense local connections within components and weaker 'long-range' connections between components, suggesting a small-world architecture. The control systems of the brain seem to embody the principles of complex systems, encouraging resilient performance.},

@article{Huang,
	Abstract = {Many studies have reported that frontal theta and posterior alpha activities are associated with working memory tasks. However, fewer studies have focused on examining whether or not the frontal alpha or posterior theta can play a role in the working memory task. This study investigates electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics and connectivity among different brain regions' theta and alpha oscillations. The EEG was collected from undergraduate students (n=64) while they were performing a Sternberg-like working memory task involving chemistry concepts. The results showed that the frontal midline cluster exhibited sustained theta augmentation across the periods of stimulus presentations, maintenance, and probe presentation, suggesting that the frontal midline theta might associate with facilitating the central execute function to maintain information in the working memory. Study of the central parietal and the occipital clusters revealed a sequence of theta augmentation followed by alpha suppression at constant intervals after the onset of stimulus and probe presentations, suggesting that the posterior theta might be associated with sensory processing, theta gating, or stimulus selection. It further suggests that the posterior alpha event-related de-synchronization (ERD) might be linked to direct information flow into and out of the long-term memory (LTM) and precede stimulus recognition. An alternating phasic alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) and ERD following the 1st stimulus and probe presentations were observed at the occipital cluster, in which alpha ERS might be linked to the inhibition of irrelevant information.},

	Abstract = {Cortical gamma band synchronization is associated with attention. Accordingly, directing attention to certain visual stimuli modulates gamma band activity in visual cortical areas. However, gradual effects of attention and behavior on gamma band activity in early visual areas have not yet been reported. In the present study, the degree of selective visual attention was gradually varied in a cued bimodal reaction time paradigm using audio-visual stimuli. Brain activity was recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and analyzed with respect to time, frequency, and location of strongest response. Reaction times to visual and auditory stimuli reflected three presumed graded levels of visual attention (high, medium, and low). MEG data showed sustained gamma band synchronization in all three conditions in early visual areas (V1 and V2), while the intensity of gamma band synchronization increased with the level of visual attention (from low to high). Differences between conditions were seen for up to 1600 ms. The current results show that in early visual areas the level of gamma band synchronization is related to the level of attention directed to a visual stimulus. These gradual and long-lasting effects highlight the key role of gamma band synchronization in early visual areas for selective attention.},

@article{Karayanidis2009,
	Abstract = {Task-switching studies show no behavioral benefit of partially informative cues. However, ERP evidence of an early cue-locked positivity elicited by both fully and partially informative cues suggests that both cues trigger an anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration (Nicholson, Karayanidis, Davies, & Michie, 2006). We examined this apparent discrepancy using a cued-trials task-switching paradigm with three tasks. The ERP finding of an early cue-locked positivity was replicated for both switch-to cues, which validly predicted an upcoming switch trial and specified the new task set, and switch-away cues, which validly predicted an upcoming switch trial but not the new task set. This component was not elicited by a noninformative cue that did not specify whether the task would switch or repeat. Switch-away cues resulted in more accurate but not faster responding than did noninformative cues. Modeling of decision processes confirmed a speed-accuracy trade-off between these conditions and a preparation benefit for both switch-to and switch-away cues. These results indicate that both fully and partially informative cues elicit an early anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration that is reflected in the early cue-locked positivity. We argue that the pattern of results is most consistent with a task set inhibition account of this early anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration.},

@article{Kayser,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and comparability of PCA-based simplifications of ERP waveforms versus their reference-free Laplacian transformations for separating task- and response-related ERP generator patterns during auditory oddball tasks. METHODS: Nose-referenced ERPs (31 sites total) were recorded from 66 right-handed adults during oddball tasks using syllables or tones. Response mode (left press, right press, silent count) and task was varied within subjects. Spherical spline current source density (CSD) waveforms were computed to sharpen ERP scalp topographies and eliminate volume-conducted contributions. ERP and CSD data were submitted to separate covariance-based, unrestricted temporal PCAs (Varimax) to disentangle temporally and spatially overlapping ERP and CSD components. RESULTS: Corresponding ERP and CSD factors were unambiguously related to known ERP components. For example, the dipolar organization of a central N1 was evident from factorized anterior sinks and posterior sources encompassing the Sylvian fissure. Factors associated with N2 were characterized by asymmetric frontolateral (tonal: frontotemporal R > L) and parietotemporal (phonetic: parietotemporal L > R) sinks for targets. A single ERP factor summarized parietal P3 activity, along with an anterior negativity. In contrast, two CSD factors peaking at 360 and 560 ms distinguished a parietal P3 source with an anterior sink from a centroparietal P3 source with a sharply localized Fz sink. A smaller parietal but larger left temporal P3 source was found for silent count compared to button press. Left or right press produced opposite, region-specific asymmetries originating from central sites, modulating the N2/P3 complex. CONCLUSIONS: CSD transformation is shown to be a valuable preprocessing step for PCA of ERP data, providing a unique, physiologically meaningful solution to the ubiquitous reference problem. By reducing ERP redundancy and producing sharper, simpler topographies, and without losing or distorting any effects of interest, the CSD-PCA solution replicated and extended previous task- and response-related findings. SIGNIFICANCE: Eliminating ambiguities of the recording reference, the combined CSD-PCA approach systematically bridges between montage-dependent scalp potentials and distinct, anatomically-relevant current generators, and shows promise as a comprehensive, generic strategy for ERP analysis.},

@article{Klimesch,
	Abstract = {The traditional belief is that the event-related alpha response can solely be described in terms of suppression or event-related desynchronization (ERD). Recent research, however, has shown that under certain conditions alpha responds reliably with an increase in amplitudes (event-related synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where subjects withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over sites that probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we assume that alpha ERS reflects top-down, inhibitory control processes. This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our hypothesis. By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes reflect rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons. Thus, the time and direction of a change - described by phase - is functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation processes. A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha phase coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase lag lies within a time range that is consistent with neuronal transmission speed. Another implication is that phase reset will be a powerful mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally sensitive measure that is related to cognitive performance. Our general conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active role for the inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation processes.},

@article{Luu,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential (ERP) peak occurring between 50 and 100 ms after the commission of a speeded motor response that the subject immediately realizes to be in error. The ERN is believed to index brain processes that monitor action outcomes. Our previous analyses of ERP and EEG data suggested that the ERN is dominated by partial phase-locking of intermittent theta-band EEG activity. In this paper, this possibility is further evaluated. METHODS: The possibility that the ERN is produced by phase-locking of theta-band EEG activity was examined by analyzing the single-trial EEG traces from a forced-choice speeded response paradigm before and after applying theta-band (4-7 Hz) filtering and by comparing the averaged and single-trial phase-locked (ERP) and non-phase-locked (other) EEG data. Electrical source analyses were used to estimate the brain sources involved in the generation of the ERN. RESULTS: Beginning just before incorrect button presses in a speeded choice response paradigm, midfrontal theta-band activity increased in amplitude and became partially and transiently phase-locked to the subject's motor response, accounting for 57% of ERN peak amplitude. The portion of the theta-EEG activity increase remaining after subtracting the response-locked ERP from each trial was larger and longer lasting after error responses than after correct responses, extending on average 400 ms beyond the ERN peak. Multiple equivalent-dipole source analysis suggested 3 possible equivalent dipole sources of the theta-bandpassed ERN, while the scalp distribution of non-phase-locked theta amplitude suggested the presence of additional frontal theta-EEG sources. CONCLUSIONS: These results appear consistent with a body of research that demonstrates a relationship between limbic theta activity and action regulation, including error monitoring and learning.},

	Abstract = {The cued-trials task-switching paradigm is used to investigate the processes involved in preparation to change task. Task switch trials typically show poorer performance than task repeat trials, suggesting that additional or more time-consuming preparation processes are required to switch tasks. However, behavioral and neuroimaging studies have so far been unable to decipher whether preparing for a switch in task involves distinct cognitive processes to those required more generally on both switch and repeat trials. The current study addresses this question using a novel multivariate pattern misclassification analysis of frequency band-specific local topographical patterns in human EEG activity that was elicited by cues varying in information value. Within the alpha frequency band, misclassification analysis produced evidence for an early switch-related preparation process over right frontal cortex, as well as a later task readiness preparation process over right parietal cortex. This represents compelling evidence for dissociable switch-related and task readiness preparation processes that show distinct time course and spatial activation patterns.},

	Abstract = {Adjustment of response threshold for speed compared with accuracy instructions in two-choice decision-making tasks is associated with activation in the fronto-striatal network, including the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and striatum (Forstmann et al., 2008). In contrast, increased response conservativeness is associated with activation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (Frank et al., 2007). We investigated the involvement of these regions in trial-by-trial adjustments of response threshold in humans, using a cued-trials task-switching paradigm. Fully and partially informative switch cues produced more conservative thresholds than repeat cues. Repeat cues were associated with higher activation in pre-SMA and striatum than switch cues. For all cue types, individual variability in response threshold was associated with activation level in pre-SMA, with higher activation linked to lower threshold setting. In the striatum, this relationship was found for repeat cues only. These findings support the notion that pre-SMA biases the striatum to lower response threshold under more liberal response regimens. In contrast, a high threshold for switch cues was associated with greater activation in right STN, consistent with increasing response caution under conservative response regimens. We conclude that neural models of response threshold adjustment can help explain executive control processes in task switching.},

	Abstract = {Groups of neurons tend to synchronize in distinct frequency bands. Within a given frequency band, synchronization is defined as the consistency of phase relations between site pairs, over time. This synchronization has been investigated in numerous studies and has been found to be modulated by sensory stimulation or cognitive conditions. Here, we investigate local field potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded from area V4 of two monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. We show that phase relations, that are consistent over time, are typically diverse across site pairs. That is, across site pairs, mean phase relations differ substantially and this across-site-pair phase-relation diversity (SPHARED, for Spatial PHAse RElation Diversity) is highly reliable. Furthermore, we show that visual stimulation and selective attention can shift the pattern of phase relations across site pairs. These shifts are again diverse and this across-site-pair phase-relation-shift diversity (SPHARESD) is again highly reliable. We find SPHARED for LFP-LFP, LFP-MUA and MUA-MUA pairs, stimulus-induced SPHARESD for LFP-LFP and LFP-MUA pairs, and attention-induced SPHARESD for LFP-LFP pairs. SPHARESD is a highly interesting signal from the perspective of impact on downstream neuronal activity. We provide several pieces of evidence for such a role.},

	Abstract = {This individual differences study examined the separability of three often postulated executive functions-mental set shifting ("Shifting"), information updating and monitoring ("Updating"), and inhibition of prepotent responses ("Inhibition")-and their roles in complex "frontal lobe" or "executive" tasks. One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

	Abstract = {EEG theta coherence, EEG theta power and subjective levels of response were examined in a continuous monitoring target detection task where periodic goal conflicts were introduced as 34 participants progressed through a stimulus sequence leading to response. EEG theta coherence revealed increases in phase locking between cortical areas at specific task stages involving goal conflict. Theta power also increased at points of goal conflict. The temporal characteristics of subjective response (measured continuously throughout the task) indicated a delay between participants actually experiencing goal conflict and overt indications of conflict. The starting point for the study was based on a specific aspect of Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal System, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford] behavioural inhibition system model-namely, septo-hippocampal system involvement in the resolution of goal conflicts. We drew on Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal system, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford] suggestion that septo-hippocampal involvement in this process is reflected by EEG theta. While their theory explains many of our findings, we also drew upon Given's [Givens, B., 1996. Stimulus-evoked reseting of the dentate theta rhythm: relation to working memory. Neuroreport 8 (1), 159-163] proposal that the dentate theta rhythm is reset by behaviourally relevant stimuli. We made further proposals based on Makeig et al.'s [Makeig, S., Westerfield, M., Jung, T.-P., Enghoff, S., Townsend, J., Courchesne, E., Sejnowski, T.J., 2002. Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses.

	Abstract = {Previous research has revealed that EEG theta oscillations are affected during goal conflict processing. This is consistent with the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) theory of anxiety (Gray & McNaughton, 2000). However, studies have not attempted to relate these BIS-related theta effects to BIS personality measures. Confirmation of such an association would provide further support for BIS theory, especially as it relates to trait differences. EEG was measured (32 electrodes) from extreme groups (low/high trait BIS) engaged in a target detection task. Goal conflicts were introduced throughout the task. Results show that the two groups did not differ in behavioural performance. The major EEG result was that a stepwise discriminant analysis indicated discrimination by 6 variables derived from coherence and power, with 5 of the 6 in the theta range as predicted by BIS theory and one in the beta range. Also, across the whole sample, EEG theta coherence increased at a variety of regions during primary goal conflict and showed a general increase during response execution; EEG theta power, in contrast, was primarily reactive to response execution. This is the first study to reveal a three-way relationship between the induction of goal conflict, the induction of theta power and coherence, and differentiation by psychometrically-defined low/high BIS status.},

	Abstract = {Preparation for a switch in task was manipulated using two types of switch cues: 'switch-away' from the previous task-set and 'switch-to' a different task-set. Increasing cue-stimulus interval resulted in a reduction in reaction time switch cost for switch-to trials only. Cue-locked difference waveforms for both switch-to and switch-away trials showed a large, broad differential positivity, relative to repeat waveforms. However, the later part of the differential positivity was significantly reduced on switch-away trials. A differential positivity then emerged after stimulus onset for switch-away trials only. This suggests that, with a long cue-stimulus interval, the new task-set was implemented before stimulus onset for switch-to trials, whereas on switch-away trials this process was delayed until after stimulus onset leading to increased switch cost. These results demonstrate dissociable effects of switching away from the current task-set and switching to the upcoming task-set and support the interpretation that the differential positivity observed for switch-to trials reflects processes associated with anticipatory task-set reconfiguration.},

	Abstract = {Synchronization of neuronal activity, often associated with network oscillations, is thought to provide a means for integrating anatomically distributed processing in the brain. Neuronal processing, however, involves simultaneous oscillations in various frequency bands. The mechanisms involved in the integration of such spectrally distributed processing have remained enigmatic. We demonstrate, using magnetoencephalography, that robust cross-frequency phase synchrony is present in the human cortex among oscillations with frequencies from 3 to 80 Hz. Continuous mental arithmetic tasks demanding the retention and summation of items in the working memory enhanced the cross-frequency phase synchrony among alpha (approximately 10 Hz), beta (approximately 20 Hz), and gamma (approximately 30-40 Hz) oscillations. These tasks also enhanced the "classical" within-frequency synchrony in these frequency bands, but the spatial patterns of alpha, beta, and gamma synchronies were distinct and, furthermore, separate from the patterns of cross-frequency phase synchrony. Interestingly, an increase in task load resulted in an enhancement of phase synchrony that was most prominent between gamma- and alpha-band oscillations. These data indicate that cross-frequency phase synchrony is a salient characteristic of ongoing activity in the human cortex and that it is modulated by cognitive task demands. The enhancement of cross-frequency phase synchrony among functionally and spatially distinct networks during mental arithmetic tasks posits it as a candidate mechanism for the integration of spectrally distributed processing.},

	Abstract = {Trial-to-trial reaction time (RT) variability is consistently higher in children and older adults than in younger adults. Converging evidence also indicates that higher RT variability is (a) associated with lower behavioral performance on complex cognitive tasks, (b) distinguishes patients with neurological deficits from healthy individuals, and also (c) predicts longitudinal cognitive decline in older adults. However, so far the processes underlying increased RT variability are poorly understood. Previous evidence suggests that control signals in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) are reflected in theta band activity and may implicate the coordination of distinct brain areas during performance monitoring. We hypothesized that greater trial-to-trial variability in theta power during performance monitoring may be associated with greater behavioral variability in response latencies. We analyzed event-related theta oscillations assessed during a cued-Go/NoGo task in a lifespan sample covering the age range from middle childhood to old age. Our results show that theta inter-trial coherence during NoGo trials increases from childhood to early adulthood, and decreases from early adulthood to old age. Moreover, in all age groups, individuals with higher variability in medial frontal stimulus-locked theta oscillations showed higher trial-to-trial RT variability behaviorally. Importantly, this effect was strongest at high performance monitoring demands and independent of motor response execution as well as theta power. Taken together, our findings reveal that lower theta inter-trial coherence is related to greater behavioral variability within and across age groups. These results hint at the possibility that more variable MFC control may be associated with greater performance fluctuations.},

Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) responses were examined separately for targets and non-targets in four different memory load conditions (0-, 1-, 2- and 3-back). The presentation of all stimuli in all memory load conditions elicited long-lasting theta frequency (approximately 4-6 Hz) ERS responses which were of greater magnitude for the target stimuli as compared to the non-target stimuli. Alpha frequency range (approximately 8-12 Hz) ERD responses were observed in all memory load conditions for both targets and non-targets. The duration of these alpha ERD responses increased with increasing memory load and reaction time. In all memory load conditions, early appearing beta rhythm (approximately 14-30 Hz) ERD responses were elicited, and with increasing memory load, these beta ERD responses became longer in duration. Additionally, beta ERS responses were observed in the 0- and 1-back memory load conditions. The current results reveal a complex interplay between brain oscillations at different frequencies during a cognitive task performance.},

In the present study we investigate the question whether varying demands on central executive processes are reflected by differences in coherent activity between and within a fronto-parietal network. We calculated coherence during a visuospatial working memory task. Under an easy executive condition subjects had to mentally imagine previously studied abstract patterns, whereas in the difficult condition, subjects had to mentally manipulate these patterns. The results indicate the involvement of prefrontal areas in executive functions reflected by a decrease of anterior upper alpha short-range connectivity and a parallel increase of fronto-parietal long-range coherence mirroring activation of a fronto-parietal network.},

These intrinsic connectivity networks showed dissociable correlations with functions measured outside the scanner. Prescan anxiety ratings correlated with intrinsic functional connectivity of the dACC node of the salience network, but with no region in the executive-control network, whereas executive task performance correlated with lateral parietal nodes of the executive-control network, but with no region in the salience network. Our findings suggest that task-free analysis of intrinsic connectivity networks may help elucidate the neural architectures that support fundamental aspects of human behavior.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive regulation enables a subject to plan actions according to context and to respond in a flexible manner to environmental conditions. This implies that foreknowledge about a change in system configuration will trigger preparatory activity in anticipation of the impending transformation. In the present study, we evaluate a unimanual task under two performance conditions that affected the cognitive context, and examine modulations in cortico-cortical interactions as determined by EEG coherence. The right hand movement was performed in an experimental paradigm that necessitated in some trials a voluntary and predictable switch towards a left hand movement, whereas in other trials no switch was required and movement of the right hand continued. The data showed that execution of the right hand movement was associated with an increased degree of task-related coherence in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) in the switching as compared to the no switching condition, and this was most apparent for fronto-parietal connections of the movement-driving (left) as well as for the primed (right) hemisphere. For the primed hemisphere, we observed that the information flow was driven from the F4 electrode overlying the prefrontal area, which suggests that anticipatory preplanning occurred. These data indicate that higher-order cognitive operations bias cortico-cortical interactions in respect of an upcoming switch of the task settings between effectors by recruiting neural resources proactively. Dynamic adjustments in the alpha band suggest that low frequency activity is a characteristic of distributed information processing related to movement planning.},

Brain-behavioral correlations revealed the functional significance of left-sided regions for successful response inhibition and switching, underlining the significant role of the left hemisphere for the organization of goal-directed activities.

The aim was twofold: 1) to identify the electro-cortical correlates of selective and non-selective inhibition processes and 2) to investigate which type of inhibition - selective or not - is required when switching between two bimanual motor patterns. The results revealed that all tasks led to enhanced activation (alpha power) of the left sensorimotor and posterior regions which seems to reflect an overall effort to stop the preferred bimanual in-phase tendency. Each task implied specific functional connectivity reorganizations (beta coherence) between cerebral motor areas, probably reflecting engagement in a new unimanual or bimanual movement.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The error-related negativity (ERN) is a response-locked brain potential (ERP) occurring 80-100ms following response errors. This report contrasts three views of the genesis of the ERN, testing the classic view that time-locked phasic bursts give rise to the ERN against the view that the ERN arises from a pure phase-resetting of ongoing theta (4-7Hz) EEG activity and the view that the ERN is generated - at least in part - by a phase-resetting and amplitude enhancement of ongoing theta EEG activity. METHODS: Time-domain ERP analyses were augmented with time-frequency investigations of phase-locked and non-phase-locked spectral power, and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) computed from individual EEG trials, examining time courses and scalp topographies. Simulations based on the assumptions of the classic, pure phase-resetting, and phase-resetting plus enhancement views, using parameters from each subject's empirical data, were used to contrast the time-frequency findings that could be expected if one or more of these hypotheses adequately modeled the data. RESULTS: Error responses produced larger amplitude activity than correct responses in time-domain ERPs immediately following responses, as expected. Time-frequency analyses revealed that significant error-related post-response increases in total spectral power (phase- and non-phase-locked), phase-locked power, and ITPC were primarily restricted to the theta range, with this effect located over midfrontocentral sites, with a temporal distribution from approximately 150-200ms prior to the button press and persisting up to 400ms post-button press. The increase in non-phase-locked power (total power minus phase-locked power) was larger than phase-locked power, indicating that the bulk of the theta event-related dynamics were not phase-locked to response. Results of the simulations revealed a good fit for data simulated according to the phase-locking with amplitude enhancement perspective, and a poor fit for data simulated according to the classic view and the pure phase-resetting view. CONCLUSIONS: Error responses produce not only phase-locked increases in theta EEG activity, but also increases in non-phase-locked theta, both of which share a similar topography. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings are thus consistent with the notion advanced by Luu et al. [Luu P, Tucker DM, Makeig S. Frontal midline theta and the error-related negativity; neurophysiological mechanisms of action regulation. Clin Neurophysiol 2004;115:1821-35] that the ERN emerges, at least in part, from a phase-resetting and phase-locking of ongoing theta-band activity, in the context of a general increase in theta power following errors.},

	Abstract = {Groups of neurons synchronize their activities during a variety of conditions, but whether this synchronization is functionally relevant has remained a matter of debate. Here, we survey recent findings showing that synchronization is dynamically modulated during cognitive processes. Based on this evidence, synchronization appears to reflect a general mechanism that renders interactions among selective subsets of neurons effective. We show that neuronal synchronization predicts which sensory input is processed and how efficient it is transmitted to postsynaptic target neurons during sensory-motor integration. Four lines of evidence are presented supporting the hypothesis that rhythmic neuronal synchronization, also called neuronal coherence, underlies effective and selective neuronal communication. (1) Findings from intracellular recordings strongly suggest that postsynaptic neurons are particularly sensitive to synaptic input that is synchronized in the gamma-frequency (30-90 Hz) range. (2) Neurophysiological studies in awake animals revealed enhanced rhythmic synchronization among neurons encoding task-relevant information. (3) The trial-by-trial variation in the precision of neuronal synchronization predicts part of the trial-by-trial variation in the speed of visuo-motor integration. (4) The planning and selection of specific movements can be predicted by the strength of coherent oscillations among local neuronal groups in frontal and parietal cortex. Thus, neuronal coherence appears as a neuronal substrate of an effective neuronal communication structure that dynamically links neurons into functional groups processing task-relevant information and selecting appropriate actions during attention and effective sensory-motor integration.},

	Abstract = {Whether neural synchronization is engaged in binding of verbal and spatial information in working memory remains unclear. The present study analyzed oscillatory power and phase synchronization of electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from subjects performing a working memory task. Subjects were required to maintain both verbal (letters) and spatial (locations) information of visual stimuli while the verbal and spatial information were either bound or separate. We found that frontal theta power, and large-scale theta phase synchronization between bilateral frontal regions and between the left frontal and right temporal-parietal regions were greater for maintaining bound relative to separate information. However, the same effects were not observed in the gamma band. These results suggest that working memory binding involves large-scale neural synchronization at the theta band.},
